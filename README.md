# StealthVPN - Undetectable VPN Protocol

A next-generation VPN designed to bypass deep packet inspection (DPI) and firewall restrictions by mimicking regular HTTPS web traffic.

## Features

üîí **Stealth Technology**
- WebSocket over TLS (WSS) protocol mimicry
- HTTP/HTTPS header obfuscation
- Packet size randomization
- Timing obfuscation to avoid traffic analysis
- Domain fronting support

üåê **Cross-Platform Support**
- Windows client with system integration
- Android client
- Linux server and client
- Web-based management interface

üõ°Ô∏è **Security**
- Custom encryption layer over TLS
- Dynamic key exchange
- Anti-fingerprinting measures
- No logging policy

## Quick Start

### Server Setup
```bash
cd server
go build -o stealthvpn-server
./stealthvpn-server -config config.json
```

### Windows Client
```bash
cd client/windows
go build -o stealthvpn-client.exe
./stealthvpn-client.exe -server your-server.com
```

### Android Client
```bash
cd client/android
# Build instructions in client/android/README.md
```

## Configuration

The VPN automatically configures itself to look like popular web services (CloudFlare, AWS, etc.) and uses dynamic port hopping to avoid detection.

## Architecture

```
Client <--WSS--> Server <---> Internet
   |                |
   |-- TUN/TAP      |-- Route Traffic
   |-- Obfuscation  |-- Deobfuscation
   |-- Encryption   |-- Decryption
```
